<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Athletick</strong> is a desktop team-management application designed for coaches and captains who manage teams of time-based
sports. <strong>Athletick</strong> allows users to manage athlete information, record training sessions and save competition results.
<strong>Athletick</strong> also allows users to monitor their training schedule and track an athlete’s attendance, performance and
sporting progress. This enables users to better manage their team, plan for trainings and prepare for upcoming
competitions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="about-the-team"><a class="link" href="#about-the-team">1.2. About the team</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Athletick</strong> was designed by a team of student athletes who were passionate about making team-management hassle-free for
captains and coaches. Our team comprises of five second-year computer science undergraduates from the National
University of Singapore (NUS) and we created <strong>Athletick</strong> as part of a requirement for our second-year software
engineering module. We were tasked with morphing a desktop address book application with the constraint that it had
to be a command line interface application. This project was completed over six weeks.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section summarizes my contribution to the project’s code, documentation and other helpful contributions to the team project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enhancement added:</strong> I added the ability to add and delete training information.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>training</code> command adds training information to Athletick. Users store the date of training and
players attended, allowing coaches to view, edit and delete past training data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coaches keep records of past trainings so they can use the information to manage their team.
Allowing coaches to store training dates allows them to monitor their training schedule and plan for future training
programs. We also allow storage of attendance information as a coach would want to know attendance for that training
session.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classes in the training feature were designed to function as a standalone unit, and do not rely on any other
components. This allows for easy extension of the feature to cater to different users. We have plans to extend the
training feature to include more information, like type of training (e.g. gym training, sprints training) and athlete
performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are 2 variations of the training command. This allows users to indicate attendance of a training
by listing members present, or by members absent. We understand that keying player attendance can be very tedious for
big teams. Giving the option to coaches to mark attendance by entering players absent will reduce the amount of
typing which will save time.</p>

</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enhancement added:</strong> I added the ability to monitor an athlete’s attendance rate.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The attendance, select, view attendance and calendar commands allow a user to track their team’s
attendance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coaches are concerned about their team’s overall attendance rate as it is a good indicator an
athlete’s commitment and how prepared an athlete is for a competition. Providing an automatic attendance tracker
removes the need for manual calculation as it can be tedious for coaches especially if there have been many training
sessions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlight:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attendance of a particular training is used in the calendar command and attendance rate is used in the
select command. A TrainingManager was implemented to provide other components use with important information from
training information and attendance rate.</p>

<p><strong>Athletick</strong> allows users to record training information like the date of training and an athlete&#8217;s attendance. This
is done using a <code>training</code> command. With this information recorded, <strong>Athletick</strong> allows users to get the team&#8217;s
overall attendance rate, and get an overview of all training sessions in a month.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <code><span class="green">Training</span></code> class stores the training information. To facilitate management of trainings, a
<code><span class="green">TrainingManager</span></code> class stores all the <code><span class="green">Training</span></code> sessions. The class diagram below shows the
interaction of different components to produce the training feature.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A training session is represented by a <code><span class="green">Training</span></code> class and it contains information like the date of
training and training attendance. The <code><span class="green">AthletickDate</span></code> class represents the date of a training session in
<code><span class="green">Training</span></code>. This class is shared across both the frontend and backend of the application, allowing training
information to be used in other features. A <code><span class="green">HashMap&lt;Person, Boolean&gt;</span></code> represents attendance in
<code><span class="green">Training</span></code> and indicates whether a <code><span class="green">Person</span></code> has attended that training session. If a
<code><span class="green">Person</span></code> attended, the value associated with him in the <code><span class="green">HashMap&lt;Person, Boolean&gt;</span></code> will be true,
and false if he did not attend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code><span class="green">TrainingCommand</span></code> is an abstract class that extends the <code><span class="green">Command</span></code> class and allows users to
record training sessions. Users have the ability to add training sessions by indicating members present or members
absent using the <code>training</code> or <code>training -a</code> commands. The <code><span class="green">TrainingCommandPresent</span></code> and
<code><span class="green">TrainingCommandAbsent</span></code> are classes that extend <code><span class="green">TrainingCommand</span></code> which allows for this
polymorphism. They are created by the <code><span class="green">TrainingCommandParser</span></code> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <code><span class="green">TrainingManager</span></code> stores and manages all <code><span class="green">Training</span></code> sessions in <strong>Athletick</strong>. It contains a
list which is used to maintain information of multiple trainings. A <code><span class="green">Training</span></code> is added to this list
whenever a user executes a <code>training</code> command. The activity diagram below shows how training information is
stored after a user executes the <code>training</code> command.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><code><span class="green">TrainingManager</span></code> also provides functions for users to calculate the attendance rate of one individual, or
the entire team. The following operations are used for this feature:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code><span class="green">TrainingManager#getPersonAttendanceRateString</span></code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Returns the person&#8217;s overall attendance rate in String
format.</p>

<li>
<p><code><span class="green">TrainingManager#getAttendanceRateOfAll</span></code> - Returns a list of everyone&#8217;s attendance rate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These operations are used by the <code>select</code>, <code>attendance</code> and <code>view attendance</code> commands. The following sequence diagram
shows how the <code>TrainingManager</code> provides other components with attendance rates.</p>

<p>Reason for choosing alternative 2: <code><span class="green">Training</span></code> and <code><span class="green">TrainingManager</span></code> are created as standalone
classes to contain training information. We intend to introduce new features (e.g. training category) in the future and this
implementation allows us to easily do so.</p>
