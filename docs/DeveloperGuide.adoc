== Introduction

This section specifies the purpose of this document and design goals of Athletick.

=== Purpose

This document describes the software architecture and system design of Athletick, a team management desktop application for coaches and team captains of timing-based performance sports. It also includes some of the design considerations for the implementation of Athletick's features.

The intended audience of this document includes the developers and software testers of Athletick.

=== Design goals

Athletick was developed as part of CS2103T, a software engineering module taken in the National University of Singapore. We were tasked to morph a generic https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/[address book application] that manages contacts into an application that manages something else. At the end of the project, it should be ready to be continued by future developers.

As part of the project constraints, the input to Athletick needs to be primarily Command-Line Interface (CLI). Non-CLI inputs will reduce the suitability of the product to our target users. Taking this into consideration, the following principles guide the design of Athletick:

. **Friendlier Syntax**
+
In order to cater to beginner and experienced users of Athletick, we have provided shorter aliases for our command words. This helps new users to use intuitive and self-explanatory commands, while advanced users can accomplish their tasks more quickly with a shorter command syntax.

. **Optimised Performance**
+
Athletick should be able to hold up to 1000 athletes, attendance and performance records without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage. To achieve this, we have used optimal data structures for storing and retrieval of data.


. **Designer Friendly**
+
As Athletick is intended for future student developers like us to make modifications and extensions to its behaviour, adhering to the high-level design architecture strictly was a necessity. This translates to extensive use of abstractions for code clarity. Additionally, we provided Javadoc comments for our classes and methods for developers to understand how they work.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== System design

This section introduces the high-level design of Athletick and gives you a basic understanding of how each component operates and interacts with one another.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[width=400]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of Athletick. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Displays the UI of Athletick.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands from the user.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of Athletick in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component Interactions for `delete 1` Command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width=500]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Athletick data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. We have included our design considerations for you to understand our decision making processes.

=== Training feature

Athletick allows users to record training information like date and an athlete's attendance. With this information
recorded, Athletick allows users to get important information like the team's overall attendance rate and an overview
of all training sessions in a month.

==== Implementation
To facilitate this, the `Model` has a `TrainingManager` that stores all `Training`
sessions in Athletick. The class diagram below shows how the different components interact with each other.

image::training_class_diagram.png[]

The `Training` class contains a date and a hash map.
The date in the training class represents the date of training session and the hash map is used to check the
attendance of a Person. We used a `AthletickDate` class to  represent a date of training. This class is shared across
both the `Ui` and backend, allowing training information to be shown in the `view calendar` function.
The hash map uses `Person` objects as keys and a boolean as it’s value. This is used to check whether a `Person` has
attended a training session, indicated by the boolean value attached to  a `Person` key. If a `Person` attended a
training session on that day, the value associated with the key will be  true, and false if he did not attend.

A `TrainingManager` is used to store and manage all `Training` sessions in Athletick. It has a list
containing `Training` sessions. A `Training` is added to this list whenever a user records a `Training` session
using a `TrainingCommand`. The sequence diagram below shows how `TrainingManager` stores and manages training records.

image::add_training.png[]

image::delete_training.png[]

`TrainingManager` provides functions for users to calculate the attendance rate of one individual, or the entire
team. The sequence diagram below shows a use case of how `TrainingManager` gets attendance rate.

image::to_add.png[]

`TrainingManager` also allows users to view `Training` information on a specified date. The sequence diagram below
shows a use case of how `TrainingManager` gets `Training` information.

image::to_add.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: Where to store attendance information of an individual.

* Alternative 1: Extend on the `AddressBook` by storing and tagging each person with number of
trainings attended and total number of trainings.

** Pros: Easy to implement.

** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and not useful when we want more detailed information
(attendance on specific date) about a training session.

* Alternative 2 (current choice): Create a separate class to manage Training information.

** Pros: Allows storing of specific training information without depending on the `AddressBook`.

** Cons: Harder to code and introduces more dependencies to Model.


Aspect: Which data structure to store training attendance.
* Alternative 1: Use a linked list to store training attendance.

** Pros: Easy to maintain.

** Cons: Accessing training information requires more time (e.g. accessing attendance rate of one person).

* Alternative 2 (current choice): Use a hash map to store training attendance.

** Pros: Makes obtaining information much quicker.

** Cons: Requires more effort to maintain.

Aspect: How to edit training information

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Edit by replacing with new training on the same date

** Pros: Users no need to type lengthy edit commands.

** Cons: Unable to support multiple trainings on same date.

** Alternative 2: Create a command to support editing of training.

** Pros: More intuitive to a user who wants to edit.

** Cons: Lengthy commands. Users have the option to edit date, attendance and even add a person.

=== Performance feature

Athletick allows users to record athlete's performance details from timed trials.
With this information recorded, Athletick allows users to get an overview of the team's capability and
progress in specific events.

==== Implementation

To facilitate this, `[green]#ModelManager#` has a `[green]#Performance#`, which has a `[green]#UniqueEventList#`.
Every `[green]#Event#` in Athletick is stored in this `[green]#UniqueEventList#`.
The class diagram below shows how the different components mentioned interact with one another.

.Class diagram for showing how Performance is implemented.
image::performance_classdiagram.png[width="250"]

As the name suggests, all `[green]#Event#` names are unique in `[green]#UniqueEventList#`.
This is ensured by `[green]#UniqueEventList#contains()#` that checks whether there is an `[green]#Event#`
with the same name before the `[green]#Event#` is added.

Every event has its own https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html[HashMap]
where performances under this event are stored. The key and value of the HashMap are explained below.

[horizontal]

Key:: `[green]#Person#` that the performance records will be under.
Value:: List of `[green]#Record#` s under the `[green]#Person#`.

.Class diagram showing how Records are stored in Event.
image::event_classdiagram.png[width="250']

This structure allows each `[green]#Person#` to have multiple `[green]#Record#` s stored in Athletick so
their progress over time can be analysed using the `[green]#AthletickDate#` and `[green]#Timing#`
attributes in `[green]#Record#`. Additionally, athlete's records can be easily retrieved by calling the
`[green]#HashMap#get()#` method.

A `[green]#Person#` will only be in the HashMap if they have a `[green]#Record#` under the `[green]#Event#`.
If their only `[green]#Record#` is removed from Athletick (using ``[green]#DeleteRecordCommand#`), they will
be removed from the HashMap as well.

`[green]#Event#` s are added using the `[green]#EventCommand#`, and `[green]#Record#` s are added using the
 `[green]#PerformanceCommand#`. In these commands, changes to `[green]#UniqueEventList#` are called through
  `[green]#Model#` in `[green]#EventCommand#execute()#` and `[green]#PerformanceCommand#execute()#` since
  `[green]#Model#` carries a common copy of all the data stored in Athletick.

The _Observer Pattern_ is adopted when displaying `[green]#Performance#` data through the `[green]#UI#`.
`[green]#Model#` exposes an unmodifable `[green]#ObservableList<Event>#` through
`[green]#Model#getPerformance#` that returns a `[green]#ReadOnlyPerformance#`. It can be 'observed'
and is updated accordingly when data in`[green]#Performance#` changes.

The following sequence diagram illustrates what happens in `[green]#Logic#` and `[green]#Model#` when in an
example scenario when `event freestyle 50m` is given as a user input.

.Sequence diagram showing the operations in Logic and Model when an event is added.
image::addevent_sequencediagram.png[width="700"]

Deleting an event (with `[green]#DeleteEventCommand#`) does the opposite. The input `delete -e freestyle
50m` will call `[green]#Model#deleteEvent()#`, after making sure the event exists in Athletick by getting a
boolean from `[green]#Model#hasEvent()#`.

The workflow for adding a record can be illustrated by the Activity Diagram below, with an example input
`performance 1 e/freestyle 50m d/31102019 t/31.20` (ie. adding a performance record for the player at index
1, for the freestyle 50m event in 31.20 seconds on 31st October 2019).

==== Design Considerations

=== Calendar feature

The calendar feature serves 2 primary functions:

. Provides an overview of training and performance records in a selected month.

. Displays training and performance records entered on a specific date.

==== Implementation

The implementation of the above functions will be described separately.

The first function is facilitated by `CalendarPanel`. It extends `UiPart<Region>` and represents the calendar via a `GridPane` with dimensions of 7 by 6 (42 cells). Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CalendarPanel#retrieveCurrentDate()` -- Retrieves the details of today's date to be used as the title of the calendar feature and for rendering the displayed month on the calendar when the user does not provide a month to view.
* `CalendarPanel#retrieveProvidedDate()` -- Retrieves the details of the date provided by the user for rendering the displayed month on the calendar.
* `CalendarPanel#initialiseSelectedDate()` -- Fills up all 42 cells of the `GridPane` with the respective days based on the selected date (current / provided date) by the user. Days of the previous and next month used to fill up the remaining cells are marked in a lighter colour.

+
In addition, days with training or performance records will be marked with a small orange or purple dot indicator respectively.

These operations are performed when an instance of `CalendarPanel` is created in the `MainWindow` class. An instance of `CalendarPanel` is created when the `CommandResult` obtained after executing the user's command contains a `Feature` corresponding to a calendar and an optional `AthletickDate`.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the first function and how the operation behaves at each step:

Step 1:. The user either issues the `view calendar` or `calendar [MMYYYY]` (e.g. `calendar 012019`) command. The first command displays the calendar for the current month, while the second command displays the specified the month and year to be displayed.

Step 2. The issued command

// to be continued

The following sequence diagram shows how the `calendar [MMYYYY]` operation works:

// sequence diagram

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `view calendar` or `calendar [MMYYYY]` command:

// activity diagram

The second function is facilitated by `CalendarDetailPanel`. It extends `UiPart<Region>` and displays the attendance and performance records for a specific date in a table. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CalendarDetailPanel#initialiseAttendanceData` -- Retrieves and displays the attendance of each person on the specified date.
* `CalendarDetailPanel#initialisePerformanceData` -- Retrieves and displays the performance records on the specified date.

These operations are performed when an instance of `CalendarDetailPanel` is created in the `MainWindow` class. An instance of `CalendarDetailPanel` is created when the `CommandResult` obtained after executing the user's command contains an `AthletickDate`.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the second function and how the operation behaves at each step:

Step 1:. The user either issues the `calendar [DDMMYYYY]` (e.g. `calendar 01012019`) command.

Step 2. The issued command

// to be continued

The following sequence diagram shows how the `calendar [DDMMYYYY]` operation works:

// sequence diagram

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `calendar [DDMMYYYY]` command:

// activity diagram (show what happens when records found vs not found)

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How the calendar for the current month is displayed
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays using a fixed 7 by 6 `GridPane`, fill up left over days with days from previous and next month.

* **Alternative 2:** Displays using a variable sized `GridPane` that is populated with days from selected month only.

===== Aspect: How the user can display the attendance and performance data on a specific date
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have one `calendar [DDMMYYYY]` command to view _both_ attendance and performance data on the specified date.

* **Alternative 2:** Have two separate commands to view attendance and performance separately on the specified date.

=== Select feature
The `select` feature allows user to view the profile of a selected athlete.

==== Implementation
The implementation of the `select` feature consists of two parts, mainly the implementation of the command and the
implementation of the UI.

The implementation of the command is facilitated by `SelectCommand` class. It extends
`Command` and parses the arguments using `SelectCommandParser`. It implements one operation:

* `CommandResult#execute()` -- Executes the selectCommand which returns the athlete selected to be displayed in the UI.

The implementation of the UI portion for the `select` feature  is facilitated by `InformationDisplay`. It extends
`UiPart<Region>` and displays the personal information of the selected athlete. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `InformationDisplay#displayPersonalInfo()` -- Displays the personal information of the selected athlete such as the
name, email, address, phone number and other personal details.

* `InformationDisplay#performanceDisplay()` -- Displays the performance of the selected athlete, which includes the
event, best performance and most recent performance.

An example usage scenario is given below which elaborates how the `select` feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `select 3` command. The command is then parsed by `SelectCommandParser` which creates
an instance of `SelectCommand`. `SelectCommand` retrieves the athlete based on the index of the list panel on the left.
When the command is executed, the athlete selected at the specified index will be stored in ModelManager as
`selectedPerson` using the operation `Model#storePerson(Person)`.

Step 2. After the command has been executed, the selected athlete is retrieved in the MainWindow class. It checks
whether an athlete has been selected and displays the selected athlete's personal information.

The diagram below summarises the steps of the example scenario when a user executes the `select` command:

.Activity diagram of `select` command execution
image::SelectActivityDiagram.png[]

The implementation was done this way because the Ui component interacts with both the Logic and Model component.
Firstly, the Ui component takes in the input from the user and allows `SelectCommandParser` in Logic component to parse
the argument.
After the argument has been parsed, the athlete is stored in the Model component which houses most of the data in the
app. The Ui listens for any changes made to the Model data, and updates the Ui to display the selected athlete.

The following sequence diagram shows the `select` feature works:

.Sequence Diagram of `select` Command
image::SelectCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
There were some decisions that I had to make as I was designing the `select` feature and had to compare which methods
would better suit the application. The following consists of the design considerations for the `select` feature.

===== Aspect: How the personal information of the selected athlete will be displayed
There were a few ways how the personal information of the selected athlete could be displayed and the following
alternatives are some of the considerations I had when implementing.

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Displaying it in a feature box.
** Pros: Minimises the use of mouse and is in line with the other features that is utilizing the feature box.
** Cons: Aesthetic is not as good compared to the other alternatives.
* *Alternative 2*: Displaying it in a tab form.
** Pros: Looks more organised compared to the other alternatives
** Cons: Not as intuitive to use as mouse has to be used to switch around tabs.
* *Alternative 3*: Displaying via a pop-up.
** Pros: Looks neater and organised.
** Cons: Increase the use of mouse to close the window and may be distracting to user.

Reason: Alternative 1 was chosen because it utilises more of the command line interface and we wanted to steer away
from the use of the mouse. Even those the aesthetic might not be as good as alternative 2 and 3, I felt that it was a
better choice as it was in line with the other features that my group mates were going to implement.

===== Aspect: How to select an athlete
There were two ways on how an athlete could be selected and it was between choosing by index or by name which I had
to consider.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Choosing by the index number.
** Pros: Intuitive to use and can be used with other commands such as `FindCommand` and `FilterCommand` to narrow
down the list of people.
** Cons: Additional step of filtering the list to make it shorter before selecting an athlete.
* Alternative 2: Choosing by name.
** Pros: Can omit the filtering step and select the athlete directly.
** Cons: There may be 2 people with the same name and thus result in an error.

Reason: In the end, I went with alternative 1 because it was more intuitive to use and was in line with some of the
other functions such as `DeleteCommand` or `FindCommand` which also uses index. It also reduces the need to type out
the full name of the selected athlete.

=== Undo / Redo feature
The undo command enables users to undo their previous commands while the redo feature enables users to redo their undone commands.

==== Undo Implementation

The undo feature is facilitated by the `HistoryManager`. The `commands` stack and the `addressBooks` stack in the `HistoryManager` class are used to govern the undo feature.

The static `commands` stack keeps track of all the commands that have been executed by the user while the static `addressBooks` stack keeps track of the corresponding state of the address book following the executed command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `HistoryManager` will be initialised with the
initial address book state pushed to the `addressBooks` stack.

image::initialStack.png[width=450]

Step 2. The user executes the delete 3 command to delete the 3rd person in the Athletick list. The delete command will be pushed into the `commands` stack in and the new state of the address book (after executing the delete command) will be pushed to the `addressBooks` stack as well.

image::afterUndoStack.png[width=450]

Step 3. The user now decides that deleting the 3rd person in the list was a mistake, and decides to undo the action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command calls the undo method in the `ModelManager` which pops the latest Command from the `commands` stack and
the latest Address Book from the `addressBooks` stack. This removes the latest action caused by the command that wants to be undone. It then continues to peek at the `addressBooks` stack to retrieve the Address Book state before the undone Command was executed.

image::initialStack.png[width=450]

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSQ.png[width=450]
Figure 1. Sequence diagram for undo feature

==== Redo Implementation

The redo feature is also facilitated by the `HistoryManager`. The `undoneCommands` stack and the `undoneAddressBooks` stack in the `HistoryManager` class are used to govern the redo feature.

The `undoneCommands` stack keeps track of commands that have been undone by the user while the `undoneAddressBooks` stack keeps track of the corresponding state of the address book following the undone command.

How the redo feature works is very similar to how the undo feature works. The difference is that redo utilises the
`undoneCommands` stack and the `undoneAddressBooks` stack. As such, you can also refer to the diagrams in the
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T12-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#undo-redo-feature[Undo
Implementation.]


==== Design Considerations
This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternative implementations of the undo and redo features.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves a deep copy of the entire address book after each command into a stack.
** Pros:  Easy to implement, and easy for developers to understand.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

====== Reason why we chose alternative 1:
Even though the memory usage of Alternative 2 is lesser, we do not feel this benefit of lesser memory usage
outweighs the tedious cost of implementing the alternative.

Furthermore, as we realise that each time the application starts, the memory of the address books states
are cleared.
This means that the cost of having alternative 1 is significantly lesser, as the memory of the address
book states does not accumulate. As such, we
decided to
go with the first alternative.


=== Adding/editing photo feature
==== Implementation
The sub feature of `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` allows the inclusion of photo for an athlete. The sub feature is
facilitated by `Photo`.

This sub feature is similar to the other features such as `Name` and `Phone` which uses a prefix `i/` followed by the
file name (e.g. `i/default.png`). Prior to adding the photo of an athlete, the image file that is going to be used
has to be in the `images` folder which will be generated when the jar file is executed. `Photo` takes in the file name as a
`String` and retrieves the photo to be added or edited from the `images` folder.

NOTE: The file name of the images is restricted to alphanumerics only and the file format that will be used is `.png`.
This is done to keep the file name simple.

==== Design Consideration
The following consists of some of the design consideration when I was designing this sub-feature.

===== Aspect: Regular expression for the file name
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** To use alphanumerics only.
** Pros: Keeps it simple without the confusion of special characters.
* **Alternative 2:** Alphanumerics and special characters.
** Cons: These special characters are reserved used by operation systems such as Windows.

Reason: Alternative 1 was chosen because it simplifies the parsing of the filename and reduces the error it might
have if special characters were included.

=== Filter feature

The filter command enables filtering of athletes based on their tags.
Currently, only filtering by one tag is supported.
Filtering by multiple tags will be available by `v1.2`.

==== Implementation

Filter makes use of a `TagMatchesPredicate` class to determine if the athlete has tags matching the user input.
Given below is the Sequence Diagram to show how filter works, with an example input of filter captain.

image::filter_sequence_diagram.png[]

Once filtering by multiple tags is implemented, the parsing of tag from `AddressBookParser` to `FilterCommandParser` will involve splitting them by spaces and storing the tag queries in a list.
Thereafter, each tag query will be compared against every athlete’s tags to determine if the athlete should be filtered.

However, since currently only filtering by one tag is supported,
the parsing of tag simply involves trimming the tag of white spaces.

Finally, the list shown to the user is updated through `Model#updateFilteredPersonsList()`.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How a tag match is determined

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Case-insensitive.
** Pros: More user-friendly.
** Cons: Requires converting tags to lower-case on the back-end.
* **Alternative 2:** Case-sensitive.
** Pros: Allows for more accurate filtering.
** Cons: Difficult for users to search, as generally filtering and searching are case-insensitive.

===== Aspect: How matches for multiple tags are determined

* **Alternative 1:** Exclusive matching.
** Pros: Allows for more accurate filtering.
** Cons: Users get fewer filter results.
* **Alternative 2:** Optional matching.
** Pros: Allows for more flexible searching.
** Cons: Users may get results that they are not interested in.

=== Sort Command

The sort command sorts the displayed list of athletes by alphabetical order. As new athletes are added to the bottom of the list, the sort command is used after to reorder the athlete list.

==== Implementation

The `sort` command makes use of a `PersonComparator` that orders athletes in alphabetical order by comparing their names. The comparison is case-insensitive.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

.Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Components for the `sort` Command
image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon completion of the above execution, the sorted list of athletes would be displayed immediately thorugh `Model#sortByName()`.

To support sorting by more parameters (e.g. by height / weight), you can simply create a new class that implements `Comparator` that compares athletes by that parameter instead. After which, you have to edit the `sort` command to support different sort command syntaxes.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: When should the athlete list should be sorted
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort address book after user issues the `sort` command
** Pros: Users are able to view their newly added athletes at the bottom of the list which is more user-friendly especially when the list of athletes is very long. Allows future expansion to sort by other methods (e.g. performance scores) easily as we only have to create new comparators to order the athletes.
** Cons: Additional overhead required in terms of having to create an additional command for users to issue.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort address book persistently in alphabetical order
** Pros: Sorting is automated
** Cons: The list is unable to be sorted by other methods (e.g. attendance rate) unless we implement alternative 1 so the alternative 2 is more limited.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
