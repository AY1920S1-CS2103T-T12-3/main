== Introduction
This document details my contribution to the team project, **Athletick**.

=== About the team

**Athletick** was completed by 4 other students and myself. We are second-year computer science undergraduates from the National University of Singapore (NUS).

=== About the project

**Athletick** is a team management desktop
application for coaches and team captains of timing-based performance sports. **Athletick** provides coaches and team captains with athlete information managing, attendance tracking and performance monitoring. This enables them to better manage their team, plan for trainings and prepare for upcoming competitions.

**Athletick** was developed as part of a requirement for our second-year software engineering module, https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2103T/software-engineering[CS2103T]. The project was completed over a period of  six weeks. We were tasked to morph a generic https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/[address book application] that manages contacts into an application that manages something else. As part of the project constraints, the input to **Athletick** needs to be primarily Command-Line Interface (CLI), where the user interacts with **Athletick** by issuing lines of commands.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

NOTE: This symbol indicates important information

[horizontal]

`command`:: A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be typed into the command
line and executed by the application.

`[green]#component#`:: Green text with grey highlight indicates a component, class, object or method in the architecture of the application.



== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

**Enhancement Added**: I added the ability to display training and performance records in the form of a calendar.

* What it does
** The `view calendar` and `calendar MMYYYY` commands allow users display a monthly calendar indicating which days contain training and performance records.
* Justification
** Being able to keep track of when training and performance records were recorded is important for coaches and captains as it allows them to find out what happened on a specific date.
** The use of a calendar to display this information is neat and easy to navigate, which makes the feature more user-friendly.
* Highlights
** This enhancement provides a platform for further development of date-related features, such as the planning of training programmes in advance.
** The implementation was also challenging because it required the training and performance features to incorporate a date for the calendar to utilise and the construction of a calendar is complex.

**Enhancement Added**: I added the ability to display training and performance records recorded on a specific date.

* What it does
** The `calendar DDMMYYYY` command allows users to display training and performance records recorded on a specific date in the form of tables. The overall team attendance rate is displayed in the form of a pie chart as well.
* Justification
** Being able to find out what happened on a specific date is important for coaches and captains to keep track of the progress of their team.
* Highlights
** This enhancement provides a platform for further development of date-related features, such as the planning of training programmes in advance. The enhancement was challenging as I had to retrieve information from complex data structures in the `[green]#Training#` and `[green]#Performance#` components which were developed by other team members.


*Minor enhancement added*: I added a sort command that allows the user to sort the list of athletes in alphabetical order.
