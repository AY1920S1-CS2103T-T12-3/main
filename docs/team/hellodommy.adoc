== Introduction

This document details my contributions to the team project, Athletick.

=== About the Team

The team consists of five Year 2 Computer Science undergraduates, including myself.

=== About the Project

The project was completed as part of a CS2103T Software Engineering module offered by the National
University of Singapore's School of Computing.

We were given six weeks to to either _morph_ or _enhance_ an existing Java product,
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book (Level 3)]. We chose to morph the
product into *Athletick*, a tool for coaches and captains to use to keep track of their
team's attendance and performance. *Athletick* also features a calendar for coaches and captains to plan
ahead, and supports the sorting, filtering, and finding of athletes their database.

Like Address Book, Athletick uses the command-line as its main method of input and a JavaFX Graphical User
Interface for display. Some constraints of the project were that it should have a command-line input, and
it should be used by a single user only. The full list of constraints can be found
https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/website/admin/project-constraints.html[here].

My role was to build the _Performance_ feature, which encompasses the adding, deleting and viewing of
events and records. Additionally, I acted as the Team Lead, where I managed milestone requirements and
delegated roles for the team.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document.
[horizontal]

`undo`:: Black test with a grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command and can be
inputted into the command-line and executed by the application.

`[green]#Performance#`:: Green text with a grey highlight indicates a component, class, or object in the
architecture of the application.

== Summary of Contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to *Athletick*.

*Enhancement addded (major):*  I added the ability to _add_, _delete_, and _view_ events and records.

* What it does: It allows coaches and captains to log records that an athlete completed for a certain
event, on a certain day, into Athletick. An event can store multiple records over time for the same athlete in
order to track their progress, which can be visualised with a line chart provided.

* Justification: It is crucial for coaches and captains to track the progress of their team over time,
hence the ability to add records. There are also different types of recordings to take in a sports team --
2.4km run, static jump, etc. --  hence the ability to add records _under different events_.
+
The ability to delete records and events was also necessary, as teams may no longer participate in certain
events, or records can be entered incorrectly.
+
Viewing

* Highlights: This enhancement works well with future extensions to further analyse and present the records
data as the required framework has been built.
+
An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary due to complex structure of the records data
which required efficient storage and retrieval. There was up to 4 levels of nesting  - a list of events,
each event with a list of athletes paired with their own list of records, each record having a date and
timing. This also made the implementation exceptionally challenging.

*Enhancement added (minor):* I added the ability to _filter_ athletes by their tags.

* What it does: It allows captains and coaches to find athletes through their tags. Filtering by multiple
tags is supported.

* Justification: When there are many athletes in a team, tags are a useful way of remembering certain
details about a particular athlete. This function enhances the existing tag feature by allowing users with
certin tags to be filtered out of the general athlete list.

* Highlights: This enhancement provides the necessary framework for further types of filtering, such as by
gender or location.
