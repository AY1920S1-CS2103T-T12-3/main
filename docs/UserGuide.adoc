== Introduction

Athletick is a team management app for team captains or coaches for timing-based sports.
Athletic supports storing of team members' *personal details, attendance tracking and performance recording*.
More importantly, Athletick is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI),
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Athletick can get your team management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* `INDEX` refers to the athlete's position in the active list.
As the index can change depending on what filters are applied, refer to the current index on the sidebar.

=== Training
Athletick allows you to record your team's training sessions, so that you can track your team's attendance and look
at past training records.

Add a training session by indicating members present (see
<<Taking attendance of a training session by athletes present : `training`>>) or by indicating absent members
(see <<Taking attendance of a training session by members absent : `training -a`>>)

After adding a training session, you can look at past trainings to check attendance on that date.

checks your team's overall attendance rate as you record trainings.

After recording a training, you can check the attendance of an athlete
(see <<Check attendance of an athlete : `attendance`>>)
or check overall team attendance (see: <<Check overall attendance of team : ` view attendance` `Coming in v1.4`>>)

Days with both training and performance entries are marked with both indicators.

==== Navigating the calendar to a specific month: `calendar MMYYYY`

This command allows you to display the calendar for a specific month of your choice.

You will need to specify the month and the year you would like to view.

Let's say that you would like to view the calendar containing training and performance records from 2 years ago (e.g. October 2017).

The athlete list in the left sidebar should be alphabetically listed now.

==== Filtering athletes by their tags : `filter`

This command filters your athletes based on their tags.

IMPORTANT: This command will change your athletes’ `INDEX`.

IMPORTANT: This command is case-insensitive, so filtering by `captain` and `Captain` will give the same result.

Let's say you want to see which athletes are butterfly swimmers
(ie. you want to filter by the `butterfly` tag).

*What you should do*

Type in the following command and press `Enter`.

Format : `filter TAG [TAG]...`

Example: `filter butterfly`

image::filter_wysd.png[width="190"]

If successfully executed,
the success message with the number of athletes that contain your specified tag will be displayed in the result box (red mark-up).
In the example given below, there are 3 athletes that have the `butterfly` tag.

image::filter_wyss.png[width="220"]

The diagram below shows the change in the active list when the filter is applied.
Notice that the `INDEX` of the athletes have changed (eg. David has changed from 4 to 2).

Subsequent commands that require `INDEX` will use the updated `INDEX`.

image::filter_change.png[width="395"]

You are also able to filter by multiple tags.

The diagram below shows the change in the active list with `filter butterfly freestyle` is applied.

Format: `help`

*What you should see*

image::help.png[width="395"]

A pop up box will appear, with a link to the user guide on Athletick.

==== Undoing a previous command : `undo`

This command restores Athletick to the state before the previous command was executed.
<<<<<<< HEAD

IMPORTANT: Take note that the `undo` feature only applies to undoable commands.
Undoable commands include: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `attendance` and `training`.

IMPORTANT: The `undo` command will not be able to undo commands that cannot be undone.
Let’s say you have executed a `list` command to list out all the athletes information in Athletick.
If you were to execute the `undo` command now, the `undo` command will fail because `list` is not an undoable command,
and that no doable commands were executed before this.

IMPORTANT: The `undo` command reverses previous commands in reverse chronological order.
Let’s say you have executed the `edit` command, followed by the `delete` command.
Executing `undo` now will first reverse the `delete` command.
Executing `undo` again will reverse the `edit` command.

IMPORTANT: The `undo` command will reverse the latest command that can be undone.
Let’s say you have executed the `delete` command, followed by the `list` command.
Since `list` command is not an undoable command, executing `undo` now will thus reverse the `delete` command.

=======
>>>>>>> e807339e4f59ac3fd67770471a2d271cd9f42b36
Let’s say you have accidentally deleted an athlete’s contact (Mohamad Ali) from your list.
Instead of having to re-enter Mohamad Ali’s contact information all over again,
you can easily restore all of Mohamad Ali’s details by `undo`-ing the `delete` command that you have just entered.

*What you should do*

Type `undo` into the command box, and press Enter to execute it.

Format : `undo`

image::undo.png[width="790"]

*What you should see*

The result box will display the message “Undo Command Success” and you can check that Mohamad Ali’s
contact information is visible in the list again!

image::afterUndo.png[width="790"]

==== Redoing an `undo` command : `redo`

This command reverses the most recent `undo` command.

IMPORTANT: The `redo` command can only reverses the `undo` command.
Let’s say that you have executed the `delete` command to delete an athlete in your list.
Executing the `redo` command now will fail because no `undo` command was executed before this.

IMPORTANT: The `redo` command reverses previous `undo` commands in reverse chronological order.
Let’s say that you have executed the `clear` command, followed by the `add` command.
Executing the `undo` command now will reverse the `add` command.
Executing the `undo` command again will reverse the `clear` command as well.
Following this, executing the `redo` command will reverse the last `undo` command and re-execute the `clear` command.
Executing the `redo` command again will reverse the second-last `undo` command and re-execute the `add` command.

Let’s say you have executed the `delete` command to delete Mohamad Ali from your list.
You may undo this action and restore Mohamad Ali’s information by executing the `undo` command. (See Undoing a previous command.)

Then, if you decide that you want the contact to remain deleted after all,
you may very quickly do so by executing the `redo` command to reverse the `undo` command that you had just executed.

*What you should do*

Type `redo` into the command box, and press Enter to execute it.

Format : `redo`

image::redo.png[width="790"]
*What you should see*

The result box will display the message “Redo Command Success” and Mohamad Ali is once again gone from the list!
