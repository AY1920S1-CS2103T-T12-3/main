== Introduction

Athletick is a team management app for team captains or coaches. The app supports storing of team members'
*personal details, attendance tracking and performance recording*.
More importantly, Athletick is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Athletick can get your team
management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `athletick.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Athletick.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
