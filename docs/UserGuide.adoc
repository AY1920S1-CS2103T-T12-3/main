== Introduction

Athletick is a team management app for team captains or coaches for timing-based sports.
Athletic supports storing of team members' *personal details, attendance tracking and performance recording*.
More importantly, Athletick is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI),
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Athletick can get your team management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

==== Undoing a previous command : `undo`

This command restores Athletick to the state before the previous command was executed.

Let’s say you have accidentally deleted an athlete’s contact (Mohamad Ali) from your list.

Instead of having to re-enter Mohamad Ali’s contact information all over again,
you can easily restore all of Mohamad Ali’s details by `undo`-ing the `delete` command that you have just entered.

*What you should do*

Type undo into the command box, and press Enter to execute it.

Format : `undo`

*What you should see*

The result box will display the message “Undo Command Success!” and you can check that Mohamad Ali’s
contact information is visible in the list again!

IMPORTANT: Take note that the undo feature only applies to undoable commands.
Undoable commands include: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `attendance` and `training`.

IMPORTANT: The `undo` command will not be able to undo commands that cannot be undone.
Let’s say you have executed a list command to list out all the athletes information in Athletick.
If you were to execute the `undo` command now, the `undo` command will fail because list is not an undoable command,
and that no doable commands were executed before this.

IMPORTANT: The `undo` command reverses previous commands in reverse chronological order.
Let’s say you have executed the `edit` command, followed by the `delete` command.
Executing `undo` now will first reverse the `delete` command.
Executing `undo` again will reverse the `edit` command.

IMPORTANT: The `undo` command will reverse the latest command that can be undone.
Let’s say you have executed the `delete` command, followed by the `list` command.
Since `list` command is not an undoable command, executing `undo` now will thus reverse the `delete` command.

==== Redoing an `undo` command : `redo`

This command reverses the most recent `undo` command.

Let’s say you have executed the `delete` command to delete Mohamad Ali from your list.
You may undo this action and restore Mohamad Ali’s information by executing the `undo` command. (See Undoing a previous command.)

Then, if you decide that you want the contact to remain deleted after all,
you may very quickly do so by executing the `redo` command to reverse the `undo` command that you had just executed.

*What you should do*

Type redo into the command box, and press Enter to execute it.

Format : `redo`

*What you should see*

The result box will display the message “Redo success!” and Mohamad Ali is once again gone from the list!

IMPORTANT: The `redo` command can only reverses the `undo` command.
Let’s say that you have executed the `delete` command to delete an athlete in your list.
Executing the `redo` command now will fail because no `undo` command was executed before this.

IMPORTANT: The `redo` command reverses previous `undo` commands in reverse chronological order.
Let’s say that you have executed the `clear` command, followed by the `add` command.
Executing the `undo` command now will reverse the `add` command.
Executing the `undo` command again will reverse the `clear` command as well.
Following this, executing the `redo` command will reverse the last `undo` command and reapply the `clear` command.
Executing the `redo` command again will reverse the second-last `undo` command and reapply the `add` command.
