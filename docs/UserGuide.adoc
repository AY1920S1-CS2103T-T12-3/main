== Introduction

Athletick is a team management app for team captains or coaches. The app supports storing of team members'
*personal details, attendance tracking and performance recording*.
More importantly, Athletick is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Athletick can get your team
management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
